## An End-to-End Encrypted File Sharing System

In this project, we applied the cryptographic primitives introduced in class to design and implement the client application for a secure file sharing system. Imagine something similar to Dropbox, but secured with cryptography so that the server cannot view or tamper with your data.

Users can take the following actions:

* Authenticate with a username and password
* Save files to the server
* Load saved files from the server
* Overwrite saved files on the server
* Append to saved files on the server
* Share saved files with other users
* Revoke access to previously shared files
